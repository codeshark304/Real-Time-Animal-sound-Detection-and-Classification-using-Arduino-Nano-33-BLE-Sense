Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/codeshark304/Real-Time-Animal-sound-Detection-and-Classification-using-Arduino-Nano-33-BLE-Sense.git

2. Install Required Libraries

Ensure you have the following libraries installed in the Arduino IDE:

TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers

PDM (Pulse Density Modulation) Library (for microphone input)

3. Upload the Code to Arduino

Open Arduino_Code/animal_sound_classification.ino in the Arduino IDE.

Select the board Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.

Upload the sketch to the microcontroller.

4. Deploy the TensorFlow Lite Model

Train your custom model using Edge Impulse.
