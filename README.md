# Real-Time Animal Sound Detection and Classification  
A real-time machine learning-based project that detects and classifies animal sounds using **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense** and **TensorFlow Lite**.

## Project Overview  
This project utilizes **Edge Impulse** to train a **TensorFlow Lite** model for classifying animal sounds. The trained model is deployed on an **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense**, which processes audio input in real time and provides classification results.

## Features  
- Real-time animal sound detection and classification  
- Uses **Edge Impulse** for ML model training  
- Runs on **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense**  
- Implements **TensorFlow Lite** for edge inference  
- Low-power, efficient sound classification  

## Repository Contents  
- **tflite-model/** → Contains the trained **TensorFlow Lite** model  
- **arduino-code/** → Arduino sketches for running inference  
- **README.md** → Project documentation  

## Prerequisites  
Before you get started, ensure you have:
